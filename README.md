# What is the discursus core platform?

Protest movements are powerful dynamics between citzens and institutions. Behind the physical manifestation of protests are discourses that morphes. They are incubators of ideas. Like viruses that mutate, spread and can change our collective ethos.

Protest events are important to understand, as they confronts us as a society and leads to healthier and more vibrant democracies. The problem is that they are hard to observe, study and analyse.

__The discursus project is an open source data platform__ that mines, shapes and exposes the digital artifacts of protests, their discourses and the actors that influence social reforms.

# Architecture

Here are the main components of the discursus core architecture:

- A miner that sources events from the GDELT project (https://www.gdeltproject.org/) and saves it to AWS S3.
- A dbt project that creates a data warehouse which exposes protest events.
- A Dagster orchestrator that schedules the mining and transformation pipelines.

# ERD

The following entities are exposed as the final output of our architecture.
